# Official "basic" Uno Rules
- everyone starts with 7 cards
- if no cards to put, you have to pick a card from a Draw pile
- if you can play the picked card, play it (or skip your turn)
- if first card on a Discard pile is a Wild card, return it to the Draw pile
- you can put down only one card at the time
- if not told Uno, player has to get 2 cards
- if first card is a special card, the effect apllies to the current player, except: Wild cards

A standard deck of Uno cards consists of 108 cards:
- 25 cards of each color (red, blue, green, and yellow)
- 19 number cards (1 zero and 2 each of one through nine)
  - 2 Draw Two cards
  - 2 Reverse cards
  - 2 Skip cards
4 Wild cards
4 Wild Draw 4 cards

Reverse – If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa. 
        It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Reverse card. 
        If turned up at the beginning of play, the dealer goes first, and the player to the 
        dealer’s right is next (normally it would be the player to the dealer’s left).

Skip – When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. 
        It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Skip card. 
        If turned up at the beginning of play, the first player (to the dealer’s left) 
        loses his/her turn. The next player to that player’s right starts the game instead.

Draw Two – When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up 
        two cards and forfeit his/her turn. It can only be played on a card that matches 
        by color, or on another Draw Two. If turned up at the beginning of play, the first 
        player draws two cards and gets skipped.

Wild – This card represents all four colors, 
        and can be placed on any card. The player has 
        to state which color it will represent for the 
        next player. It can be played regardless of whether 
        another card is available. If turned up at the beginning 
        of play, the first player chooses what color to continue play.

Wild Draw Four – This acts just like the wild card except that 
        the next player also has to draw four cards as well as forfeit 
        his/her turn.
